# Miscellaneous thoughts

Most of these papers only seem to be describing either Dec results or Hep results, not both. 

Most of these papers are using data from IAAF. Why? 

A lot of papers only analyse top scores/performers. 

We're going to have a massive sample size. Consider commenting on the cluster analysis and 3- or 5- cluster solution for the decs. (woolf et al., 2007; cox & dunn, 2002)

It may be that the dec scoring system naturally encourages the sprinters, who can swallow mediocre scores in SP DT and JT events. Because of the different number of events, the Hep might not disadvantage certain profiles as much ... we should consider this. The idea of our profiles are that these are perhaps distinct combinations of physiologies and talents in multi-events, but when combined with the constraints of the scoring system, optimization looks different for each event. We should consider combining hep and dec data ... what would that look like?

Most cluster analyses have used scores, but each score calculation is a nonlinear transformation of the event results, thus there is a difference in the change in standardized scores for the same change in standardized performance across events. This will impact the analyses. While perhaps not an issue when making interpretations about the relationship of performances with an eye to maximize total score, there is a clear implication when making interpretations on the physiological taxation of the events and implications for training regimens. 

Van Damme et al. and others have done correlation analyses, and found that in a restricted sample of excellent performances there are some negative pairwise correlations, implying there are specialists. However, in a larger database, there are mostly all positive correlations: 

- maybe we should do this study in two parts. One part using top athletes, and doing an LPA, and a growth model for them since they are known. And another with the NCAA data, and compare the two, to discuss implications for training and development. 
- perhaps we also search IAAF for the athletes in our NCAA dataset to get more longitudinal data. 

# Decathlon

## Cox and Dunn (2002)

Title: [An analysis of decathlon data](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-9884.00310?casa_token=qo3zCjfIAuQAAAAA:j1kg5-BC_9cRxowJRmlGJ4M7jdcnpkcSHn10b0MvyaZdrmHPuGVCqMxxL6Xufii_opbYOhrS9Z2yKQ)

Citation: Cox, T. F., and Dunn, R. T. (2002). An analysis of decathlon data. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series D (The Statistician), 51(2), 179-187.
<br>
<br>
Data: IAAF World Championships between 1991-1999 (5 meets)
<br>
RQ: Internal Structure, and, Is event order fair?
<br>
<br>
Methods: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, correlational analysis
<br>
Findings: 

- Clusters: Three cluster solution: {100m, 400m, LJ, 100mh}, {SP, DT, JT, PV}, {HJ, 1500m}. Two cluster solution separates 'track' events from 'field' events ({100, 400, 110, LJ}, {SP, DT, JT, PV, HJ, 1500}) and accounts for 50% of the variance

- Variances: "The order of the 10 sample standard deviations is: 400m, 100m, 110mh, Dis, SP, LJ, HJ, Jav, PV, 1500m. Note that the three smallest standard deviations are for track events. The field events have larger standard deviations. This suggests that the decathlon could favour those athletes who are good in the field events." (p. 183)

- Fairness: "for four [out of 5] of the meetings, the events ‘agree’ with each other on the ranking of the athletes." (p. 184) "tentative conclusion from the above analyses is that the decathlon favours those athletes who can do well at the field events." (p. 187)

<br>
RQ: 
<br>
<br>
Methods: Correlational analysis
<br>
Findings: 

- Correlation between event score and total score show many changes over the two decades (see Table 5)
- In the last twenty years, top heptathletes have improved the most in the throwing events, on aggregate.
- "A correlation analysis showed that 100mh, 200m, and LJ had the biggest influence on the final result in heptathlon" (p. 162)

## Woolf et al. (2007)

Title: Grouping of decathlon disciplines
<br>
Citation: Woolf, A., Ansley, L., & Bidgood, P. (2007). Grouping of decathlon disciplines. Journal of Quantitative Analysis in sports, 3(4).
<br>
<br>
Data: personal best decathlon results over 8000pts in international competitions between 1986 and 2005
<br>
RQ: 
<br>
<br>
Methods: Cluster analysis
<br>
Findings: 

- Three cluster solution: {100m, 400m, 110mh, LJ, PV, HJ}, {SP, DT, JT}, {1500m}
- Four cluster solution: {100m, 400m, 110mh, LJ, PV}, {SP, DT, JT}, {HJ}, {1500m}
- Five cluster solution: {100m, 400m, 110mh, LJ}, {SP, DT, JT}, {PV}, {HJ}, {1500m}
- The five cluster solution is better than the three cluster solution, even in a re-analysis of Cox and Dunn (2002)'s data.
- "All six solutions assigned the first three track 'running' disciplines to a different group from the three 'throwing' disciplines (p. 5)
- Small sample size may not have power to demonstrate the superiority of the 5-cluster solution. This study has larger sample size than Cox and Dunn (2002), and while results are similar, it appears that 5-cluster solution is better. 
- "the composition of the clusters suggests that athletes who perform better in the sprint/track disciplines may be afforded an advantage as there are four disciplines in which they are likely to do well; whereas only three of the field disciplines are contained in the next largest cluster. This assumption is further strengthened by the observation that the average ranking of the top ten decathletes in the disciplines that comprise the first cluster is 11th, while their average ranking in the disciplines that comprise the second cluster is 27th."  *Well, perhaps the 'sprinter' profile is an easier path, but are they really better within the profile?*

<br>
<br>
Data: 33 performances, with an average score of 7219
<br>
RQ: 
<br>
<br>
Methods: simple linear regression
<br>
Findings: 

- lower score decathlon refers to low versatility and preference of running and jumping over technical throwing disciplines. 
- this is basically the same as Brodani et al. (2020), only with different data, and a different conclusion, only the model looks the same, and has similar results. 
- also, scores are for sure collinear -- this isn't addressed.

<br>
Data: Olympic decathletes between '88 and '08 (n=166)
<br>
RQ: determine a limited number of latent factors (‘motor abilities’) that define success in decathlon (reproduce Zatsiorsky and Godik 1962)
<br>
<br>
Methods: PCA
<br>
Findings: 

- total score mainly influenced by 100m 400m 110mH and LJ
- first component is "sprinting" (100m, 400m, 11mh, and negative LJ)
- second component is "throwing jumping" (JT, SP, DT HJ, PV)

- "In 1962, V. Zatsiorsky and M. Godik performed factor
analysis (centroid method) of the decathlon performance in
athletes participated in 1960 Olympic Games. The study
was motivated by the desire to determine a limited number of
latent factors (‘motor abilities’) that define success in
decathlon and, as a consequence, to help coaches and athletes
in designing optimal training programs that take into
consideration the inter-event similarity and possible transfer of
training results." (p. 1)

<br>
Data: 92 olympic decathletes from 1984 to 2000
<br>
RQ: in an elite subset, are correlations between events still observed?
<br>
<br>
Methods: standardized scores by event. comparison of highest standardized score to average standardized score by athlete
<br>
Findings: 

- Within Van Damme et al's (2002) analysis of 600 decathletes, there is a subset that behaves differently. That is, that a uniform relatively high performance in all individual events is required to effectively compete at the top level.
- Efforts should be made to train for uniformity of performance

<br>
RQ: trade-off between specialist and generalist phenotypes
<br>
<br>
Methods: standardized partial correlation analyses
<br>
Findings: 

- negative correlation between some pairs of events
- "These results seem to support the idea of trade-offs generated by conflicting anatomical (such as relative body weight and limb proportions) and muscle-fibre-type requirements"
- "The influence of an individual athlete’s training schedule or career development on these apparent trade-offs also needs to be determined." (p. 756)
